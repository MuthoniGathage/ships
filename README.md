# ships
-An analysis of global ship fleet types from the year 1980 to 2020.
-I got to use Python packages: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Geopandas and dataprep.
-Data source was Kaggle.
-The analysis sought to answer the questions:
    1. Which countries own the biggest fleets?
    2. What does the change look like over 1980-2020?
    3. Under what specialty are most ships registered(oil tankers,container ships, bulk carriers,etc)?
    4. Where are most ships built?
    5. Where are most ships scrapped?I got to use Python packages: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Geopandas and dataprep. I extracted the data from Kaggle. 
Conclusion: 
1.
